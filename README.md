An event based python UI library using CEFPython

*and asyncio, but I'm bad at that. But it works. Please don't look at the code.*

### Requirements
 * asyncio
 * cefpython
 * win32gui (optional)

Huh, I swear I expected more.

### How to
	Look at example.py


### Todo
	* Rewrite The event class into a Function Factory instead of creating classes for each Event
